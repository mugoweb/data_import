the 'fromString' is a new function in eZ Publish 3.9+. The idea is to have a String representation
of all differnet eZ Attribute types.

Here a documentation about how that string should look like for each eZ Attribute type.


ezauthor:
to sparate one author from another '&' char is used, to separate parts of author data
'|' is used. The system escapes '|','&','\' with the '\' char.
example of toString result

Administrator User|sp@ez.no|0&Sergiy|bla@fooo.tt|1&SP|sp@ez.od.ua|2

to make it easy to parse such kind of strings the class ezstringutils is added under 
lib/ezutils. It has to functions as a members.
explodeStr( $str, $delimiter = '|' ) and implodeStr( $str, $delimiter = '|' ). The first one 
explodes string to an array with delimiter char, the difference from PHP explode/implode is 
that these functions do propper escaping/unescaping of all values.


ezbinaryfile:
toString function of this datatype return string of next format:
filepath|original_filename
filepath is to a file so you can copy this file in a place you want,

since it is not nice to have file name as md5 of something.
if you want to import binary file to the attribute you need to supply it with full path 
to the image argument.
