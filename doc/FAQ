1) How to import HTML
------------------------
The data import extension allows to import HTML into eZ Publish
XML Block data types. Therefore the system has to tranlate the
HTML text into the eZ Publish XML format. For example, it has
to translate <p>My text here</p> to <paragraph>My text here</paragraph>

To simplify the process, this extensions contains a parser that is
doing the job for you. But notice that the eZ Publish XML parser for
XML blocks is very picky. At least it gives concrete error messages
when a parsing failed.

A working example is in XMLFolders.php:

	$xml_text_parser = new XmlTextParser();
	$xmltext = $xml_text_parser->Html2XmlText( '<p>My text here</p>' );

So all you need to do is to get an instance of XmlTextParser. The class
is under data_import/classes/Html2XmlText.php.

In case the parsing failed you can read the error messages like that:

print_r( $xml_text_parser->get_error_messages() );

If the PHP tidy extension is installed the parser will use it and will
greatly improve the success rate of parsing a given HTML text.



2) How to import multiple translations
--------------------------------------------
The extension allows to import multiple languages per eZ Object.

Try the example to see how it works.

The XML file ( "dataSource/examples/multilanguages.xml" )
contains multiple entries with the same ID. For example
it contains 3 entries in 3 different languages but all
three have the same ID ("100"). Each entry specifies
the language code in XML ( language="eng-GB" ). Make sure
that the language code exists in your eZ Publish
installation -- check "Setup" -> "Languages". The language
code in the column "Locale" must match the language code
in the XML file.

Run the example:

prompt> php5 runcronjobs.php import_multilanguages_xml



3) How to import object relations
--------------------------------------
There are two typical scenarios when it comes to import
object relations. Examples:

i) Article has an object relation to a video
ii) Article has object relations to other articles

The first scenario is a little easier to handle. Basically
you just need to make sure to import the video object first.
When that's done, you'd need to import the articles and in
case of the object relation attribute on the article, your
"DataSourceHandler" needs to lookup the video object id and
store it into the object relation attribute of the article.
The lookup typically use the remote id (fetchByRemoteId)
because you explicitly set a remote id for videos in the first
import.

The 2nd scenario is a bit tricky, because you need a 2-step
approach. The first import would create all articles without
the object relations. Then you need an additional script to
update each article and add the object relation to other
articles. Again, working with remote ids (fetchByRemoteId) is
recommended.
